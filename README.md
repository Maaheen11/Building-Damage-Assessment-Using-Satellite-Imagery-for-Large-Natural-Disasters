# Building-Damage-Assessment-Using-Satellite-Imagery-for-Large-Natural-Disasters
This project focuses on detecting and classifying the extent of building damage caused by natural disasters using satellite imagery. Leveraging deep learning models, the system identifies damaged structures in post-disaster scenarios and categorizes the severity of damage from no damage to destroyed.
